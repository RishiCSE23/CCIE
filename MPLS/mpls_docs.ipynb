    "1. Packets enter into the SP nework as a normal IP Packet through the PE router.\n",
    "2. The PE router __pushes__ a label into the packet. \n",
    "3. __Label Distribution__: The LDP protocol distributes the labels among other participating routers\n",
    "3. __Label Switching__: Intermediate (P) routers switches labes and forward the packet across the SP core.\n",
    "4. __Multi-protocol__: MPLS packets can be carried on any L2 protocol.  \n",
    "4. The far-side PE Router __pops__ the label and releases normal IP Packet (_The actual pop happens at the penlatimate router to the PE, called Penaltimate Hop Poppoing (PHP)_)\n",
